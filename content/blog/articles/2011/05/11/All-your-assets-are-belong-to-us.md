I always loved startups that solved a real problem for me.

I mean, opposed to the ones trying to invent the problem right with it, like how I'll might
communicate next year and delivering the solution for the problems around that. They do sometimes come up with fascinating stuff, yet I feel most inspired by the ones targeting my daily life incoveniences, by automating, simplifying, archiving, connecting.

So I rather put my money in online TV recorders, E-Mail services, project management, source control, billing systems, snail mail generators (they print your digital stuff and send it in paper, incredible), all services build around saving me time. I use to call them "convenience services", out of the lack of a better name.
They are often the ones with the least "buzz", but they are of great value to the individual user.

So with Assets.io we want to be exactly like that. We want to solve a real world problem for you, by minifying, concatenating, compressing and
delivering your assets as fast as possible. We want to push up your page rank and optimize your website experience with the least amount of work.
We want to do it faster and more thorough then you can do in a reasonable amount of time, so you can focus on everything else, content, design, whatever _really_ inspires you.

You cook, we serve.
