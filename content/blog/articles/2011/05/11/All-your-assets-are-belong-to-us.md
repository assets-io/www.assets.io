title: All your assets are belong to us

We always loved services that solve a real problem for us.

As opposed to the ones inventing the problem right along their solution, like how we might
communicate next year. They do sometimes come up with fascinating stuff, yet we feel most inspired by the ones targeting our daily life's incoveniences, by automating, simplifying, archiving, connecting.

So we rather use E-Mail services, project management, source control, billing systems, snail mail generators (they print your digital stuff and send it in paper, incredible), all services built around saving us time. We use to call them "convenience services", for lack of a better name.
They are often the ones with the least "buzz", but they are of real value to the individual user.

So with Assets.io we want to be exactly like that. We want to solve a real world problem for you, by minifying, concatenating, compressing and delivering your assets as fast as possible and by following best practice standards. We want to push up your page rank and optimize your website experience with the least amount of work for you. We want to do it faster and more thorough then you could do in a reasonable amount of time, so you can focus on everything else, content, design, whatever _really_ inspires you.

You cook, we serve.
