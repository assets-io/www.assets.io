    %h3 Minification
    %p CSS and JS files are automatically minified, making them much smaller by removing whitespace and comments and shortening identifiers, so less bandwidth is needed.

    %h3 Packaging
    %p CSS and JS files can be concatenated into packages, reducing the number of server requests and boosting performance.

    %h3 Content Delivery Network
    %p All your assets are cached and distributed through a CDN, a network of servers around the world to serve your files from the closest location to the the site's visitor.

    %h3 Fast setup
    %p The setup is as easy as loading your assets through our simple Javascript API instead of referencing them directly. We fetch the assets from your server automatically, no manual file handling needed.

    %h3 Easy cache busting
    %p You don't have to deal with cache invalidation issues on the CDN - whenever you have a new version of an asset, just update the version number in the include code and it gets repackaged and distributed instantly.

    %h3 Fallback solution
    %p If anything should fail on our side, the API falls back to your original asset sources after a configurable timeout, so your site continues to be usable, no matter what.
